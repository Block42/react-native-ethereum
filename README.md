# react-native-ethereum-wallet

It doesn't look like much. There is a Button and if you click it, it shows you the balance of a hardcoded address.
The application also loads an account from a hardcoded json address file and prints that address on clicking the button.

This example is just a simple Proof of Concept, so the code is not pretty nor is it supposed to be re-used anywhere else.

Run with `npm start`. Run  on android with `npm run android`. After running, it takes some time to connect to nodes and sync with the main ethereum network - before it is connected to any peers, the button does not work.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).
